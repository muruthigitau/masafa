# Accounts Component README

## Overview

The `accounts` folder in the Next.js project contains key components for user authentication and profile management, including a login form, layout, loading indicators, logout mechanism, profile settings, and more. These components work together to create a seamless and responsive user experience for managing user authentication and account settings.

## Components

### 1. Layout Component

The `Layout` component serves as a wrapper for the login form and provides a consistent visual structure and styling for the login interface, enhancing the overall user experience.

- **Props**:
  - `children`: Allows the inclusion of child components, such as the login form itself.
  - `gradientFrom` and `gradientTo`: Define the gradient background colors for the layout, adding aesthetic appeal.
  - `className`: An optional prop for additional CSS classes, allowing for further customization.

- **Features**:
  - Applies a gradient background that spans the full screen, creating a visually striking entrance to the login form.
  - Centers the login form vertically and horizontally, making it user-friendly across various devices.
  - Includes a `ToastContainer` for displaying notifications, ensuring users receive feedback about their login status.

### 2. Loading Component

The `Loading` component indicates that a process is ongoing, specifically during the login operation.

- **Features**:
  - Displays a fixed overlay that covers the entire screen with a semi-transparent black background, signaling to the user that an operation is in progress.
  - Features multiple colored dots that blink in sequence, drawing attention and indicating activity, which keeps users engaged while waiting.

### 3. LoginForm Component

The `LoginForm` component is the core of the user authentication process, handling user input, login logic, and navigation upon successful login.

- **State Management**:
  - Maintains local state for user credentials (username and password) and a loading state indicating whether the login process is in progress.

- **Login Logic**:
  - Invokes an asynchronous login function, which communicates with the backend API to authenticate the user.
  - On receiving a successful response, it:
    - Displays a success notification.
    - Saves the authentication token in the database for future requests.
    - Checks if it is the user's first login; if so, it redirects the user to an OTP verification page. For returning users, it redirects them to the home page.

- **Form Handling**:
  - Includes two input fields: one for the username and one for the password, both of which are required.
  - Labels adjust based on user interaction, ensuring clarity regarding required information.

- **User Feedback**:
  - Notifications provided through the ToastContainer alert users to success or failure in the login process, enhancing the user experience.

### 4. Logout Component

The `Logout` component is responsible for handling user logout functionality, ensuring a secure and user-friendly experience when users choose to log out of the application.

- **State Management**:
  - Uses a state variable to manage the visibility of a confirmation modal before executing the logout process.

- **Logout Logic**:
  - Invokes an asynchronous function to communicate with the backend API for logout.
  - On successful logout:
    - Removes the authentication token and username from cookies to ensure that user sessions are terminated securely.
    - Redirects the user to the login page.

- **User Confirmation**:
  - Displays a confirmation modal to prevent accidental logouts, prompting the user to confirm their decision before executing the logout logic.

### 5. ProfilePage Component

The `ProfilePage` component provides a user-friendly interface for displaying and editing user profile information, managing account settings, and confirming profile deletions.

- **State Management**:
  - Maintains local state for profile data, edit mode status, and modal visibility for confirmation on profile deletion.
  - Uses `useRef` to reference the profile edit form for easier manipulation.

- **Profile Data Fetching**:
  - On component mount and whenever the editing state changes, it fetches user profile data from the API and updates the state accordingly.

- **Edit Functionality**:
  - Toggles between view and edit modes, allowing users to edit their profile information directly on the page.
  - Handles changes to form fields and updates the local state accordingly, ensuring that only modified fields are sent back to the server upon save.

- **Update Logic**:
  - When the user saves changes, it sends the modified data to the API for updating the profile.
  - Notifies the user of success or failure through toast notifications, enhancing the user experience.

- **Profile Deletion**:
  - Provides a confirmation modal for users to confirm their intent to delete their profile.
  - On confirmation, it sends a delete request to the API and redirects the user to the profiles list or home page upon successful deletion.

- **Rendering**:
  - Displays the user's profile picture, name, and role, along with options to edit the profile or save changes.
  - Includes components for profile information, messages, and settings, maintaining a structured layout for the profile page.

### 6. ProfileEditForm Component

The `ProfileEditForm` component facilitates editing the user's profile information, enabling a smooth and intuitive user experience for making updates.

- **State Management**:
  - Uses `useEffect` to populate the form fields with existing user data when the `user` prop is updated.
  - Maintains local state for the form data, which includes fields like first name, last name, email, phone, location, bio, and password.

- **Input Handling**:
  - Provides controlled input fields for each piece of user data, ensuring that changes are reflected in the component's state immediately.
  - Includes a handler function for input changes that updates the form data state based on user interactions.

- **Form Submission**:
  - Implements a form submission handler that prevents the default form submission behavior and calls the `onSubmit` function with the current form data.
  - Uses `useImperativeHandle` to expose a `submit` method, allowing parent components to programmatically submit the form.

- **Rendering**:
  - Renders a form with input fields for each profile attribute, along with appropriate labels and styles.
  - Applies validation attributes like `required` to ensure necessary fields are filled out before submission.
  - Offers a user-friendly layout that adapts well to different screen sizes.

### 7. ProfileInfo Component

The `ProfileInfo` component displays detailed information about the user's profile, enhancing the user experience by providing quick access to important data.

- **Props**:
  - `userData`: An object containing user profile information, such as name, phone number, email, location, username, role, and timestamps for account creation and last login.

- **Rendering**:
  - Utilizes a responsive layout to present profile information in a structured format, making it easy for users to review their details.
  - Displays the user bio at the top, followed by an organized list of key profile attributes.

- **Icons and Styling**:
  - Incorporates Font Awesome icons next to each profile attribute for a visually appealing presentation and better user experience.
  - Each attribute is encapsulated within a styled list item, using colors to distinguish different sections and enhance readability.

- **Fallback Values**:
  - Each profile attribute has a fallback value (e.g., "N/A" or "No bio available") to ensure that users see meaningful information even if some data is missing.

### 8. ProfileMessages Component

The `ProfileMessages` component presents a summary of messages or notifications relevant to the user’s profile, improving user engagement by keeping them informed.

  - Each message includes a "View" link that users can click to learn more or take action, enhancing interactivity.

- **Styling**:
  - Utilizes a responsive design with flexbox layout to ensure a visually pleasing experience on various devices.
  - Each message item is styled with rounded corners and subtle shadows, creating a card-like appearance that enhances readability and visual hierarchy.

### 9. ProfileSettings Component

The `ProfileSettings` component allows users to manage their account settings, including notification preferences and account privacy options.

- **State Management**:
  - Uses local state to maintain user preferences, such as email notifications and privacy settings.

- **Settings Fetching**:
  - Fetches the current settings from the API on component mount and updates the local state accordingly.

- **Settings Update Logic**:
  - When users make changes and submit the form, it sends the updated settings to the API for persistence.
