# Documentation System Overview

This documentation system has been developed to dynamically fetch and display information from all README files within the project. The aim is to improve accessibility to component documentation and user guides for developers and end-users.

## Features

1. **Dynamic Data Extraction**: The system scans the entire project directory for any files named `readme.md` (case-insensitive). This means any README file, regardless of its location within the project structure, will be processed.

2. **Documentation Structure**: For each README file found, the system extracts the first line as the section title and collects a preview of the first few lines as steps. This provides a summary of what the documentation entails.

3. **JSON Output**: The extracted data is saved into a JSON file. This JSON file serves as the source of truth for the documentation displayed on the documentation page.

4. **User-Friendly Interface**: The documentation is displayed in a structured format on a dedicated documentation page. Users can expand or collapse sections to view more details about each component or process.

5. **Quick Navigation**: The documentation page includes a quick navigation feature that allows users to jump to specific sections, enhancing the usability of the documentation.

## Implementation Overview

1. **Python Script**: The primary functionality is encapsulated in a Python script that:
   - Recursively searches for README files in the project's directory.
   - Reads the contents of each README file to extract relevant information.
   - Generates a JSON file that stores this information in a structured format.

2. **React Component**: A dedicated React component is responsible for:
   - Fetching the JSON data generated by the Python script.
   - Rendering the data in a user-friendly format, allowing for interaction (e.g., expanding sections for detailed views).

3. **Integration**: The system is designed to trigger the data extraction process when the documentation page is accessed, ensuring that the information displayed is always up to date.

## Conclusion

This documentation system streamlines the process of accessing component documentation within the project. By automatically gathering and displaying relevant information from README files, it enhances the development experience and provides a valuable resource for users seeking guidance on various components and their usage.
